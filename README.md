# Lip-to-Text-Conversion-using-Deep-Learning


## Overview

This project demonstrates a deep learning model for converting lip movements in video sequences into corresponding text. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, this project aims to provide an efficient and accurate system for lip reading.
